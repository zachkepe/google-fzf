# GoogleFZF
GoogleFZF is an open-source Chrome extension that enhances web and PDF search with AI-powered contextual capabilities. Unlike traditional "Ctrl/Cmd+F", it understands similar words and phrases, running entirely in-browser for privacy and speed.

## Features
- Semantic Search: Finds contextually similar text using GloVe embeddings and cosine similarity.
- Fuzzy Search: Matches approximate text with Fuse.js.
- Exact Search: Classic keyword matching.
- PDF Support: Intercepts and renders PDFs with searchable text layers.
- Privacy-First: All processing happens locally, no data leaves your browser.

## Architecture
- Background: Manages TensorFlow.js initialization, PDF fetching, and message passing.
- Content: Handles page text extraction, highlighting, and search execution.
- Popup: Provides a sleek UI with mode selection and match navigation.
- Worker: Offloads semantic search computation for performance.
- Tech Stack: TensorFlow.js, GloVe embeddings, pdfjs-dist, Fuse.js.
